## Snippets
* Learn to use enum() so invalid states are impossible
* Don't write code that doesn't need to be written again!
     - (Open/Closed) principle  
* Objects cannot change their type
* Inheritance is often called for in Frameworks or UI libraries
* Libraries - Code your code uses
* Framework - Code that uses your code (often classes provided that you extend  )

## Notes
* Followed much of the testing that was being coded, got the overall concept but lost a few times due to may some unfamiliarity with the IDE
* Actually coding the kata really helped, used Google to find some string split things here and there and passed the first few tests
* Not so sure on the dummy stuff, might become more clear tomorrow?
