* Learned some [git](/docs/github)
* And how to deploy using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
     - Link GH account and basically just click *deploy*

* Lots of info on using VS
* Even more info on unit testing 

* Got a bit lost following some of the unit tests during the banking example but understood the logic mostly
     - As a result, got practice pulling, discarding , re-pulling, and rebuilding my (someone elses) code

* Definitely going to follow a little bit closer tomorrow.
